# About State Change in React
Let me give an example of the function of increasing the number by one. So we cannot simple do the  value ++ or value = value ++ to change the state. Rather we have to use predefined hook UseState which actually does embedd the logic of our function that is increasing the number by one and under the hood render the dom and update the state by own without demanding us to write the code of DOM manipulation which we were used to write in the time of vanilla JS.It does the updating work for us and just demand us to initialize the vlaue and set the Value using the UseState.So eventually we dont have to write code for DOM.
