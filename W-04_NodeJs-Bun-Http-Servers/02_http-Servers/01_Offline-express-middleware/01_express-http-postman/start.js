// The issue with your code is that the input value from the query parameter (req.query.a) is a string, but the sum function expects a number. When you pass a string to the sum function, the loop condition (i <= a) fails because the comparison between a number (i) and a string (a) doesnâ€™t work as expected. As a result, the loop never runs, and the total remains 0.
